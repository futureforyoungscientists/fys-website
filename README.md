Future for Young Scientists is an organization that offers online science classes to children around the world, free of cost. Our lessons revolve around interactive experiments that utilize common household materials to expose these children to various fields of science.

We founded Future for Young Scientists with the mission to inspire children to think critically, like scientists. We believe that fostering scientific curiosity at a young age is essential to get our students on a path to learn about the STEM field. Through the engaging nature of hands-on learning, lessons become more appealing and fun while bringing out the inner curiosity that is present in every child.
